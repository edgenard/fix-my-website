# Fix my Website
I've got a pretty good website built there are a few things wrong with it.
Some of the links don't work and some of the images aren't showing up. The styles don't show
up any page but the homepage.


## Fix the look and navigation

### Fix navigation links
The navigation links on the first page work, but they don't work on any other page.
Can you figure out why and fix it?

### Fix the styles
The styles show up on the home page but they don't show up on other page.

### Fix the images
Some of the images aren't showing up in the other pages. I think something must
be wrong with the image tag on those pages. Please figure this out and fix it.

### Break
Once you've fixed the link, styles and images on every page it's time to save your work and commit.

1. Save every file
2. In the terminal window type:
  ```
  git add --all
  git commit -m "Fixed links, styles and images"
  git push -u origin
  ```
3. You may run into a problem with `git push -u origin` if you do don't worry we'll work it out together.

## Fix the functionality
I wrote some JavaScript using JQuery to do some cool things in my website but some of it doesn't work. I think I some of the pages are missing a link to JQuery. There are some things I wanted to do but didn't get to please finish it up for me.

### Quote Page Buttons
There is definitely a bug with the buttons on the quotes page. I wrote some JavaScript using JQuery that is suppose to show a picture of the person who said the quote but only the first picture is shown no matter which button you click. Can you figure out what is going on with this?

### Favorites Page Images
Everytime someone hovers their mouse over pictures I want the picture fade out and the fade in. I didn't have time to implement this, would you please do it?
