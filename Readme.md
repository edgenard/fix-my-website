# Fix my Website
I've got a pretty good website built there are a few things wrong with it.
Some of the links don't work and some of the images aren't showing up. The styles don't show
up any page but the homepage.


## Fix the look and navigation

### Fix navigation links
The navigation links on the first page work, but they don't work on any other page.
Can you figure out why and fix it?

### Fix the styles
The styles show up on the home page but they don't show up on other page.

### Fix the images
Some of the images aren't showing up in the other pages. I think something must
be wrong with the image tag on those pages. Please figure this out and fix it.

### Break
Once you've fixed the link, styles and images on every page it's time to save your work and commit.

1. Save every file
2. In the terminal window type:
  ```
  git add --all
  git commit -m "Fixed links, styles and images"
  git push -u origin
  ```
3. You may run into a problem with `git push -u origin` if you do don't worry we'll work it out together.

## Fix the functionality
I wrote some JavaScript using JQuery to do some cool things in my website but some of it doesn't work. I think I some of the pages are missing a link to JQuery. There are some things I wanted to do but didn't get to please finish it up for me.
