      I am a web developer who use to run a theater company.
      I became interested in programming and software development when I had to
      build a website for the theater company. Lately, I've been inspired by the
      work and ideas of Alan Kay, Bret Victor, Kathy Sierra and Sebastian Deterding.
      Their work inspires me because they all have the same basic goal of using
      computing to help people get a better understanding themselves and the
      world they live in. They are all trying to use technology to "augment human intellect".
      I hope to be able to do the same.
